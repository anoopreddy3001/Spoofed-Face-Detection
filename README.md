# SPOOFED FACE DETECTION

## Introduction
In the realm of face recognition systems, the threat of spoofing attacks by malicious users is a significant concern. These attackers may attempt to deceive the system by presenting a photo or video of another person instead of their own face, thereby gaining unauthorized access. To counter such attacks, spoofed face detection algorithms are crucial. By distinguishing between genuine and spoofed faces, these algorithms enhance security and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.

## Problem Definition
The primary objective of this project is to develop a facial recognition system capable of discerning between real faces and spoofed replicas. This system aims to identify whether the individual in front of the camera is a genuine person or a fraudulent attempt to deceive the facial recognition system using images or videos. By detecting spoofed faces, the system mitigates the risk of unauthorized access and fraudulent activities.

## Literature Survey
Research in facial recognition has made significant progress, but the threat of spoofing attacks remains prevalent. Various studies highlight the vulnerabilities of existing face authentication systems to spoofing attacks using photographs or videos. Countermeasures against face spoofing attacks, including heuristic algorithms and advanced liveness detection techniques, have been proposed to enhance system security. However, further research is needed to develop more robust anti-spoofing solutions.

## Objectives
The objectives of this project are as follows:
- Develop a facial recognition system capable of detecting spoofed faces.
- Implement anti-face spoofing algorithms to distinguish between genuine and fake faces.
- Provide real-time feedback on the legitimacy of detected faces.
- Enhance security in scenarios requiring facial authentication, such as online exams and sensitive data access.

## Module-wise Breakdown
1. **Segmentation Module**: Identifies and isolates faces from input frames.
2. **Face Tracking**: Tracks the movement of detected faces across successive frames.
3. **Face Classification**: Classifies detected faces as genuine or spoofed using deep learning models.
4. **Merging**: Integrates classification results and outputs the probability of a face being fake or real.

## Algorithm
The algorithm consists of the following steps:
1. Input frames from recorded video or real-time webcam.
2. Apply segmentation to detect regions of interest (ROIs) corresponding to faces.
3. Track faces across successive frames and associate them with unique identifiers.
4. Extract features and classify faces as genuine or spoofed using pattern classifiers.
5. Merge frames and display the output with the probability of each face being fake or real.
